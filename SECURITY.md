## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using the AbacatePay PHP SDK, please follow these security guidelines:

### API Token Security
- Never commit your API tokens to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
- Rotate your API tokens periodically
- Use different tokens for development and production environments

```php
// Good Practice
\AbacatePay\Clients\Client::setToken($_ENV["ABACATEPAY_TOKEN"]);

// Bad Practice - Never do this
\AbacatePay\Clients\Client::setToken("abc123xyz...");
